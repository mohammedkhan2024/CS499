# This is the main entry point for the Family Expense Tracker application.
# It sets up the Streamlit interface, manages session state, handles navigation,
# and renders each UI section including member input, expense entry, financial overview,
# and visual analytics. It also provides a sidebar for budget limit configuration
# and initializes stateful tracking like budget performance.
